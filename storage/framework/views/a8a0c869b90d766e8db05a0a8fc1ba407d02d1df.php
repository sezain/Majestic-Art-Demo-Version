                                    Medieval Art in the Western world covers over a thousand years of art across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Medieval Art includes several distinct movements and periods based on genre, region and time period, such as Early Christian Art, Byzantine Art, Anglo-Saxon Art, Viking Art, Insular Art, Romanesque Art and Gothic Art, amongst others.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Medieval artwork was produced on varying media, such as medieval sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, stained glass, metalwork, mosaics, tapestries and fresco wall-paintings.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    The advent of classical art and the Renaissance marked the end of the production of medieval art. During the Renaissance, and for some time afterwards, the artistic legacy of art produced in the middle ages was disparaged and ascribed very little value, before interest and understanding of such pieces was achieved in the 19th century as the study of art history developed. It is now rightly viewed as a period of great achievement, which was actually largely responsible for the development of <a href="https://majesticarts.com/western-art">Western Art</a> as we know it.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    It was the scholars of art history who were responsible, in large part, for the documenting and dating of pieces of art from the Middle Ages that had survived the centuries of apathy and scorn that had been directed at it. With the resurgence of interest in medieval art, museums and private collectors began collecting such pieces heavily, ensuring the protection of the remaining pieces.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Medieval art in Europe is a product of the artistic heritage of the Roman Empire and the early Christian church, which have, over time, combined with the other contemporary cultures across Northern Europe to produce a remarkably rich and varied artistic legacy that is highly valued and sought after, centuries after it was produced.
