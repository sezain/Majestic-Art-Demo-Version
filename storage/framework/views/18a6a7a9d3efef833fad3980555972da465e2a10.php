                                    Western art sculptures encompasses all visual art produced in Europe (and later, the Americas)- from the prehistoric age right through to post-modernism. What began in the form of rock and cave paintings during the Paleolithic Age, eventually evolved into Classical Renaissance, Impressionist, Modern, and Postmodern art.
                                    <br><br>
                                    While the first examples of Art in the Western world do date back to the Paleolithic Age, its evolution was by no means uninterrupted. Cave paintings and rock paintings were the two main forms of art all the way up till the Iron Age that have still survived, largely due to a lack of technology and lack of any other long-term medium that the art could be transcribed upon.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Written histories on the subject usually begin around the 3rd millennium BC, as several examples of western artworks from the period have been recovered in areas where settlements existed at the time. The artistic development during the times of the Greek civilisation and Roman Empire are fairly well-documented, as several examples of western artwork from the time have been recovered- allowing art-historians to trace the growth in the field over the course of time.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The Roman Empire carried its style of artwork as it conquered large swathes of Africa and Europe, thus influencing the development of art in the region long after the end of the Empire. For several centuries after that, art declined- both in terms of quantity and quality. It was a subject that did not appear to be given a lot of attention during this time- until its reemergence in the Medieval Age.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The reemergence of art during the Medieval Age is far more significant than many people realise because it is from this point onwards that the development of western art can be traced in an uninterrupted manner. This allows art historians to study the principles and styles that survived, as well as those that were rejected- allowing them a base from which they could gain insight into the minds of the famous western artists during those times.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Old Western Artwork during the Medieval time may have begun as a reclamation project, trying to undo the effects of centuries of stagnation, but it eventually morphed into something far greater- eventually leading to the birth of Classical Art during the period of the Renaissance age.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Classical Art eventually morphed into Modern art and Postmodern Art. One of the most notable features of modern and <a href="https://majesticarts.com/postmodern-art">Postmodern Art</a> is that while all art that preceded it focussed mainly on the issue of religion, Modern and Postmodern Art contain hardly any references to the subject, instead choosing to focus on political subjects.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Western art paintings represents a continuous, though disrupted, tradition from antiquity until the present time and has given the world some of the greatest art pieces of all times through superlative use of colour, emotion and light.
