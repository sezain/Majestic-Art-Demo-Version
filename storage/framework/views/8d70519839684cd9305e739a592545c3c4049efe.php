                                    Postmodern art encompasses a body of varied art movements that contradict certain aspects of  
                                    <a href="https://majesticarts.com/modern-art">modern art</a>. Postmodernism is characterized by certain distinct features, such as the use of text as the central artistic element, the use of several distinct entities to create a new whole, the emphasis on the concept rather than the aesthetic and the recycling of past themes and ideas with the addition of a modern-day twist.
                                    <br><br>
                                    One of the most unique characteristics of postmodern art is the use of both high and low culture through the use of media such as industrial media and pop culture imagery. Due to the focus on the concept over the aesthetic, famous postmodern artists use such media in order to convey their message with an ease that modern artists struggle to replicate. Postmodern artwork is universally noted for blurring the distinction between high and low art. While such concepts have been experimented with by modern artists, they have truly only been fully endorsed by the postmodern movement.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Movements that began as part of the modern art movement, such as minimalism and pop art, began to be viewed as the precursors for postmodern art, or the transition to postmodern art, after the split between formalism and anti-formalism in the 1970s.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Jackson Pollock is viewed as a revolutionary in the field of postmodern art. His move from easel painting and conventionality liberated his contemporaries, as well as generations of artists who came after him. He postulated that the journey towards making a work of art was as important as the work itself, and this gave birth to the abstract impressionism movement.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Famous postmodern artists realized that his work had allowed them the license to push the boundaries of what is considered art, allowing them to explore new avenues that would previously have been scoffed at, such as conceptual art, installation art, lowbrow art, performance art and even digital art.
