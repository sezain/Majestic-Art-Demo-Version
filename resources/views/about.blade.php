                        Art has existed since the beginning of time but its relevance, form, and importance in everyday life has evolved. It is considered to be the pinnacle of human creative expression, exhibited through paintings, sculptures, and architecture. Art often tells a story, reflecting the values and aspirations of the period. The art industry is estimated to be worth approximately USD 65-70 billion. But currently, there is a major gap in reliable art authentication.
                        <br> <br>
