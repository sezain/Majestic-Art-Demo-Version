                        Art has existed since the beginning of time but its relevance, form, and importance in everyday life has evolved. It is considered to be the pinnacle of human creative expression, exhibited through paintings, sculptures, and architecture. Art often tells a story, reflecting the values and aspirations of the period. The art industry is estimated to be worth approximately USD 65-70 billion. But currently, there is a major gap in reliable art authentication.
                        <br> <br> 
                        Majestic Arts addresses this requirement by outsourcing the authentication process to a world-renowned reliable company. which has far more experience and database with modern technology  than most of the contemporary authenticators. Majestic Artsâ€™ unique authentication arrangements with a unique business models, combined with its unfettered access within the art world make it the most reliable ideal choice.

                                   There is currently a major gap in the art authentication market for new, innovative methods of testing. Majestic Arts addresses this pressing requirement through its unique multispectral imaging process, which is far more efficient than the current X-ray testing that most authenticators use while facilitating the buying, selling, scouting and evaluation of arts and artifacts.
